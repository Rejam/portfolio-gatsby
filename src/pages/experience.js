      <h1>Relevant experience</h1>
      <p>
        Showcase some projects you’ve worked on, but keep it to the type of
        project you would like to work on again.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, maybe you used to be a marketing strategist. However, now
        you want to land a job as a Ruby on Rails developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure to emphasize projects/work experience related to Ruby on
        Rails. Otherwise, employers might assume that you’re still interested in
        working with marketing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same can be said for LinkedIn: only feature previous work and skills
        you want to be hired for.
      </p>

      <p>
        (Bonus: include testimonials from previous employers/clients to take
        your experience section to the next level.)
      </p>

      <h2>
        Provide context Don’t just give a job title; provide context, too.
      </h2>

      <p>
        A potential employer looking at your site will not be able to take away
        much with just a job title.
      </p>

      <p>Consider including:</p>

      <p>
        Who it was for Project/job description When (dates) Any relevant
        screenshots/URLs/code samples to the work Context is especially
        important for those who want to do more freelance/consulting kinds of
        work. If that is the case for you, even consider doing “before and
        after” screengrabs to demonstrate how you improved the project.
      </p>
