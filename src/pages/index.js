      Downloadable resume A lot of people in HR still rely on hard-copy resumes.
      Make yours easy to find (put a download button in the footer or sidebar)
      and print-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t go overboard with every little detail. Include relevant highlights.
      And don’t forget to include your personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others may have your skills, experience and even education—but your
      hobbies and personality quirks are what make you, you!
    </p>
    <p>
      This can help you stand out from the rest, and it makes you more
      personable. Likeable people have an easier time getting hired.
    </p>

    <h2>Relevant social media profiles</h2>
    <p>
      For developers, there are two social media networks that are basically
      non-negotiable:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Github</li>
      <li>Linkedin</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Of course, feel free to list a Twitter handle if you have one. It’s also
      not a bad idea to link to your Stack Overflow profile—but only if you are
      an active user and have a high reputation score.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adding relevant social media accounts is a way for potential employers to
      get a better idea about your personality and what you’re like beyond your
      “About me” section.
    </p>

    <h2>Relevant skills</h2>

    <p>
      Don’t go crazy. Include only your strongest skills, and ones that will
      prove useful in the type of job you’re looking for.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example: if you’re looking for back-end development work, you can probably
      leave out your Photoshop expertise. Instead, emphasize the skillsets these
      positions are looking for. (Unsure? Check out job postings online to see
      the listed skills; have your portfolio/online resume match as much as
      possible. Of course, don’t ever list a skill you don’t really have! That
      will come back to bite you.)
